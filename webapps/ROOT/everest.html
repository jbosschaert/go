                <dt><i>Day 1:</i></dt>
                <dd>We arrived in Lukla airport at about 9 o'clock, we had the second flight of the day. We had some breakfast and were on our way... 
                    On the first day the trekking was supposed to be light however, we were all very tired from traveling and the "easy" trek was extremely difficult. Lukla is at 2800m and we were going to Phakding which is 2600m, 
                    so we were going down. But it did not feel like this. We arrived in Phakding at about 4 or 5 in the afternoon, absolutely exhausted. 
                    The trek that day was absolutely spectacular and I was mesmerised by the Nepalese countryside and tranquility. There were no cars and all along the trek there are Buddhist symbols, 
                    including Stupahs, prayer walls, Manes (prayer wheels) and prayer flags. It is beautiful.We also met many yaks and mules along the way carrying loads up and down the mountain. 
                    It was difficult to believe we were still on planet Earth! </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 2:</i></dt>
                <dd>The next day we were going to be trekking up and it was to be a much more difficult day. We were going to Namche Bazaar (3400m. However, after a good night sleep and some hearty porridge in the morning I was rearing to go!
                    The walk was once again spectacular, and I realised that I found it more enjoyable to walk up, than down, I know I'm weird! We crossed many rope bridges and I was surprised that they were less scary to cross than I had anticipated.
                    We had guides to guide us along the trek, and they also looked out for us throughout the journey. They were continually checking up on us and making sure we were drinking enough, no one wanted to get altitude sickness! 
                    The last two hours to Namche were extremely difficult. They were two hours of steep up, it was probably also very difficult due to the fact that our bodies were not yet adjusted to the altitude and that we were not prepared for the climb, mentally.
                    When we got into Namche I had never been happier, when we arrived it was misty and we had not yet realised the beauty of this town. Namche is the largest town which you pass on the trek, there are many shops and there is even an ATM there!
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 3:</i></dt>
                <dd>We were now in Namche, we were a lot higher up than I had ever been, and due to this we were going to be spending an acclimatisation day here. I thought this would mean that we would be going for a walk around Namche, and relaxing.
                    This was <b>definitely</b> not the case! We were going to the Everest View Hotel (3880m)and hoped that the weather would be clear and we would get our first glimps of Everest! We left and started the steep climb. It was very difficult and 
                    after an hour and half of going straight up we made it. We arrived on the terrace and the entire sky was covered by clouds. We decided we wouldn't give up and we ordered tea, and waited for the clouds to clear. After a while the clouds began to clear up, 
                    and soon we got our first view of Everest! It may not look spectacular but to see the highest mountain in the world for the first time is AMAZING!
                    When we were finished drinking our tea we left to go to a different town named Khumjung. Here we would have lunch and go visit a Buddhist monastery. The monastery was extremely interesting. I have never seen anything like it before,
                    there are masks, statues, prayer books everywhere, and everything is decorated with a lot of colour.
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 4:</i></dt>
                <dd>The next day we were off again! Today we were going to Tengboche (3900m). The walk was quite easy at first, mostly flat, or Nepali flat I should say, it's up, and down and up and down, but not steep up! The final two hours before Tengboche was a beautiful trek.
                    We walked up a mountain through the rhododendrons (the Nepali national flower!). They were beautiful, and eventhough the trek was steep the pace which was set was very good, and we did not have to stop very often to catch our breath! When we arrived in Tengboche 
                    we were just too late to go to the ceremony held at the Buddhist monastery there every day, but we did get to go in and see the monastery. This monastery was very big and was the main monastery in the area. 
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 5:</i></dt>
                <DD>Day 5 was again an easy enough trekking day. I was difficult because we were now going to high altitudes, but the terrain was not too steep. We were on our way to our next stop, Dingboche (4600m), in Dingboche it was becoming more, and more evident 
                    that we were not at normal altitude anymore, we were crossing a threshold, there was no more real vegetation. All you could see was rocks, and boulders. Another shock was that Ama Dablam (6812m) which had seemed in the distance and so far away was now
                    beside us, we had walked that far! It was an amazing feeling, WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIMALAYAS! In Dingboche the living condition were also much harsher, we didn't even have a sink to wash our hands anymore, and the rooms were extremely cold. 
                    As well as this, there were restrictions on electricity usage of general things like lights. The lights could only be turned on between 7PM and 10PM. For all other electricity usage e.g. Camera/Phone charging we had to pay at each lodge of course!
                </DD>
                <dt><i>Day 6:</i></dt>
                <dd>In Dingboche we had another acclimatisation day. Today we were going to climb up to a view point just outside the village which was just shy of 5100m! We would have to do this trek in the morning before lunch, because there were no lodges on the way up, 
                    we would have to eat lunch in the lodge. This trekking day may sound easy, but it was far from it! For 3 and a half hours straight we walked up a <b>really</b> steep mountain. However, as usual the hardship was definitely worth it! The views from on top 
                    of that view point were amazingly spectacular. I had never been so proud of something before, and really felt like I accomplished something when we stood on top of that mountain. However, when we had reached the top we were not finished yet, we still needed 
                    to get down again! I found this much more difficult than going up. This was the day that I found out that I find it much more rewarding to walk up, than to walk down. It took us an hour and a half to get back down to the lodge again, and by this time we were
                    wrecked, and hungry! After lunch we decided to go in search of an internet cafe so we could contact our family and friends. By now it was snowing a blizzard outside and it was amazing to see how different the landscape looked covered in snow than it had the day before, 
                    you would not have recognised the place!
                </dd>
                <dt><I>Day 7:</I></dt>
                <dd>Day 7 and we're nearly there! Today we walked from Dingboche to Loboche(4900m), the final stop before Base Camp Everest!! The trek was very nice, and not too strenuous. After lunch we passed through a memorial for all those who had lost lives on Everest. 
                    It was a beautiful place. There were lots of prayer flags and memorial stones, in many different languages of course! That afternoon we had a quick walk to Loboche. 
                    The views were spectacular, as always and we were extremely happy to have an interesting luxury at this lodge, we had... double glazed windows! It was something so small but made us so happy!
                    We had an extra day built into our itinerary so that we could stay n extra acclimatisation day here if we didn't feel up to the long trek to Gorek Shep then Everest B.C. and back to Gorek Shep the next day, however, it was advised to keep going if possible as it would reduce
                    the risk of altitude sickness. We felt great, so we decided to go for it the next day, i was so excited, <i>"Tomorrow I'm going to BASE CAMP EVEREST!!"</i> I kept thinking! 
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 8:</i></dt>
                <DD>It was the big day, we are going to B.C. Everest today! We left Loboche(4900m) at about 8:30 AM and we reached Gorek Shep by lunch time. The trek was amazing and I was amazed by the Khumbu Glacier,
                    I had never seen a glacier before and it was completely different to anything I had imagined. In Gorek Shep we refueled with lunch, and bought some water bottled for the trek, and we were off! We were on the final leg to B.C. Everest(5365m)!
                    I felt great, I have never felt better. The landscape is amazing, you can't imagine that rocks, boulders, and ice can be beautiful but it really is, all the shapes that you see emerge in the grey. At about 3PM we made it! We got to Everest Base Camp!! 
                    We had a small celebration, took some pictures, but we decided not to go into base Camp where all the summiters stay, we did not want to give them any colds that we may have. So we went back to Gorek Shep after about half an hour. I had expected the trek 
                    back from B.C. to be sad and disappointing, however, I was bursting with energy, probably high with energy because as we got back to the lodge in Gorek Shep I crashed, we all did. We went to bed extra early, we were getting up at 4AM the next morning to climb Kalapathar(5545m)!
                    This may sound like a crazy plan, but there is a very valid reason to this madness, when you are at the top of Kalapathar you get a great view of Everest and it would be amazing to see the sun rise behind Mount Everest!
                </DD>
                <dt><i>Day 9:</i></dt>
                <dd>We got up at 4AM, I wouldn't have been able to sleep any longer anyway, the beds were uncomfortable, it was dusty, dirty and cold. We put our head-torches on and headed out in the cold. It was pitch black, but it beautiful, I felt like I was walking on the moon, 
                    however, there was gravity, of course, but all you could see was grey boulders, rocks and huge mountains in the dark. Anyway, it was cool! The hike up Kalapathar was extremely difficult, I can easily say this was the most difficult part of the entire trek. 
                    The mountain was extremely steep and as we hiked our water started to freeze in our bottles. I don't know how but after about 2 and a half hours we made it to the top, and it was totally worth it. The views were spectacular, Everest seemed so close! 
                    But now we had another problem, we still needed to get back down. It took an hour to get back down to Gorek Shep, and then we had breakfast, however, this was not the end of our trekking day, we still had a 5 hour trek ahead of us to Phereche(4600m). 
                    We did the trek in great time and were in Phereche in less than 5 hours, we had descended a great amount and you could really feel the difference on your body, however, we were still extremely tired, we had trekked for more than 8 hours that day and had been to 
                    Everest Base Camp the day before! The next day would be another trekking day but nowhere near as strenuous! 
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 10:</i></dt>
                <dd>We got up at 7:30AM the next morning, we were in no hurry at all, it was day 10 and today we are trekking for a few hours to Deboche(3820m). We were going back to vegetation, at the beginning I had not missed the trees and flowers at all but at this stage I was getting a bit bored of 
                    the rocks and boulders! We left late at about 9:30, however we still got to Deboche by lunch time. The route we took on the way back was slightly different to the way we walked on the way up, so we were still seeing different things, and we went to see another monastery, in Pangboche. 
                    This monastery was very interesting and different to the others, it was also a very small one, there was a monk chanting and hitting a drum, part of the ritual was also to throw rice, and I was very interested by the whole thing. The weather was very nice and sunny when we got to Deboche 
                    and we decided to do some washing, the washing place was the most tranquil place I had ever been. However, when you looked behind you, you were faced with the harsh reality of mass tourism in an area like this. There was a huge mound of plastic bottle piled behind the shed, it was just too
                    expensive to get all the rubbish carried down to Lukla, where it would then have to be brought somewhere else. I couldn't believe that we only had 3 trekking days left, I was looking forward to going to Namche the next day, where I was going to do shopping and buy present to bring home, and 
                    use the internet cafes they have there, however, I didn't want the trek to end!
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 11:</i></dt>
                <dd>Day 11 and we were going back to Namche, it seemed like so long ago that we were there the first time! I was excited to go back, it was very strange but most of the trekking was quite steep up, that day, but we still descended about 400m, and we were back in Namche(3400m) before lunch time.
                    In Namche we went shopping, we bought beautiful Pashmina scarfs, "yak yak yak" t-shirts, a yak wool blanket and hats, everything was so cheap! I was surprised by the prices!
                    This was also an exciting day because we were being reunited with a member of our original team, one girl in our group had fallen ill in Dingboche, and she was forced to go back to Kathmandu, our team leader, who had organised the whole trip, went with her. The girl had now gone back home and healthy,
                    our missing team leader still had a week in Nepal so she decided to get a plane to Lukla and she trekked from Lukla to Namche and we were going to see her today! Only two trekking days left! Can't believe it!
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 12:</i></dt>
                <dd>It was now day 12 and we were leaving Namche and heading to Phakding(2600m). Today it was raining, and we realised just how lucky we had been during the trek, we had never really walked through the rain! It didn't rain that hard, but it was different to walking through the sunshine!
                    The views were still spectacular of course, I was shocked to see how small the mountains had gotten, this would be the last day that we would be able to see the big peaks! We were leaving the mountains. When we arrived in Phakding I was surprised and sad to realise that we only had one more trekking day left.
                    I would love to just trek through the mountains every day, unfortunately this is not possible, I still have to go to school... I decided that I would treasure the next day, the last day of trekking and make sure that I enjoyed it to the full.
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 13:</i></dt>
                <dd>It's the last day of trekking, day 13. I was sad to be leaving the mountains, but the day was so nice that nothing could darken my mood, until my head started to split, I was getting a migraine. Luckily this day of trekking was not long, and when we got to Lukla, I went to my room in the lodge and slept for a few hours,
                    I slept the migraine off and I woke up at 3:30PM, a new person! That eveming we had a meal with our guides(they didn't eat with us) and our porters(who carried our bags). At this dinner we presented them with their tips, and it turned out to be a lovely evening.
                    We ate good food, and then put some Nepali folk songs on like "Resham Firiri", we danced to the songs, and chatted. We didn't go to bed too late we were leaving before 6AM the next morning, to catch our flight back to Kathmandu! It's all over! We did it!
