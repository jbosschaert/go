                <dt><i>Day 1:</i></dt>
                <dd>We arrived in Lukla airport at about 9 o'clock, we had the second flight of the day. We had some breakfast and were on our way... 
                    On the first day the trekking was supposed to be light however, we were all very tired from traveling and the "easy" trek was extremely difficult. Lukla is at 2800m and we were going to Phakding which is 2600m, 
                    so we were going down. But it did not feel like this. We arrived in Phakding at about 4 or 5 in the afternoon, absolutely exhausted. 
                    The trek that day was absolutely spectacular and I was mesmerised by the Nepalese countryside and tranquility. There were no cars and all along the trek there are Buddhist symbols, 
                    including Stupahs, prayer walls, Manes (prayer wheels) and prayer flags. It is beautiful.We also met many yaks and mules along the way carrying loads up and down the mountain. 
                    It was difficult to believe we were still on planet Earth! </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 2:</i></dt>
                <dd>The next day we were going to be trekking up and it was to be a much more difficult day. We were going to Namche Bazaar (3400m. However, after a good night sleep and some hearty porridge in the morning I was rearing to go!
                    The walk was once again spectacular, and I realised that I found it more enjoyable to walk up, than down, I know I'm weird! We crossed many rope bridges and I was surprised that they were less scary to cross than I had anticipated.
                    We had guides to guide us along the trek, and they also looked out for us throughout the journey. They were continually checking up on us and making sure we were drinking enough, no one wanted to get altitude sickness! 
                    The last two hours to Namche were extremely difficult. They were two hours of steep up, it was probably also very difficult due to the fact that our bodies were not yet adjusted to the altitude and that we were not prepared for the climb, mentally.
                    When we got into Namche I had never been happier, when we arrived it was misty and we had not yet realised the beauty of this town. Namche is the largest town which you pass on the trek, there are many shops and there is even an ATM there!
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 3:</i></dt>
                <dd>We were now in Namche, we were a lot higher up than I had ever been, and due to this we were going to be spending an acclimatisation day here. I thought this would mean that we would be going for a walk around Namche, and relaxing.
                    This was <b>definitely</b> not the case! We were going to the Everest View Hotel (3880m)and hoped that the weather would be clear and we would get our first glimps of Everest! We left and started the steep climb. It was very difficult and 
                    after an hour and half of going straight up we made it. We arrived on the terrace and the entire sky was covered by clouds. We decided we wouldn't give up and we ordered tea, and waited for the clouds to clear. After a while the clouds began to clear up, 
                    and soon we got our first view of Everest! It may not look spectacular but to see the highest mountain in the world for the first time is AMAZING!
                    When we were finished drinking our tea we left to go to a different town named Khumjung. Here we would have lunch and go visit a Buddhist monastery. The monastery was extremely interesting. I have never seen anything like it before,
                    there are masks, statues, prayer books everywhere, and everything is decorated with a lot of colour.
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 4:</i></dt>
                <dd>The next day we were off again! Today we were going to Tengboche (3900m). The walk was quite easy at first, mostly flat, or Nepali flat I should say, it's up, and down and up and down, but not steep up! The final two hours before Tengboche was a beautiful trek.
                    We walked up a mountain through the rhododendrons (the Nepali national flower!). They were beautiful, and eventhough the trek was steep the pace which was set was very good, and we did not have to stop very often to catch our breath! When we arrived in Tengboche 
                    we were just too late to go to the ceremony held at the Buddhist monastery there every day, but we did get to go in and see the monastery. This monastery was very big and was the main monastery in the area. 
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 5:</i></dt>
                <DD>Day 5 was again an easy enough trekking day. I was difficult because we were now going to high altitudes, but the terrain was not too steep. We were on our way to our next stop, Dingboche (4600m), in Dingboche it was becoming more, and more evident 
                    that we were not at normal altitude anymore, we were crossing a threshold, there was no more real vegetation. All you could see was rocks, and boulders. Another shock was that Ama Dablam (6812m) which had seemed in the distance and so far away was now
                    beside us, we had walked that far! It was an amazing feeling, WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIMALAYAS! In Dingboche the living condition were also much harsher, we didn't even have a sink to wash our hands anymore, and the rooms were extremely cold. 
                    As well as this, there were restrictions on electricity usage of general things like lights. The lights could only be turned on between 7PM and 10PM. For all other electricity usage e.g. Camera/Phone charging we had to pay at each lodge of course!
                </DD>
                <dt><i>Day 6:</i></dt>
                <dd>In Dingboche we had another acclimatisation day. Today we were going to climb up to a view point just outside the village which was just shy of 5100m! We would have to do this trek in the morning before lunch, because there were no lodges on the way up, 
                    we would have to eat lunch in the lodge. This trekking day may sound easy, but it was far from it! For 3 and a half hours straight we walked up a <b>really</b> steep mountain. However, as usual the hardship was definitely worth it! The views from on top 
                    of that view point were amazingly spectacular. I had never been so proud of something before, and really felt like I accomplished something when we stood on top of that mountain. However, when we had reached the top we were not finished yet, we still needed 
                    to get down again! I found this much more difficult than going up. This was the day that I found out that I find it much more rewarding to walk up, than to walk down. It took us an hour and a half to get back down to the lodge again, and by this time we were
                    wrecked, and hungry! After lunch we decided to go in search of an internet cafe so we could contact our family and friends. By now it was snowing a blizzard outside and it was amazing to see how different the landscape looked covered in snow than it had the day before, 
                    you would not have recognised the place!
                </dd>
                <dt><I>Day 7:</I></dt>
                <dd>Day 7 and we're nearly there! Today we walked from Dingboche to Loboche(4900m), the final stop before Base Camp Everest!! The trek was very nice, and not too strenuous. After lunch we passed through a memorial for all those who had lost lives on Everest. 
                    It was a beautiful place. There were lots of prayer flags and memorial stones, in many different languages of course! That afternoon we had a quick walk to Loboche. 
                    The views were spectacular, as always and we were extremely happy to have an interesting luxury at this lodge, we had... double glazed windows! It was something so small but made us so happy!
                    We had an extra day built into our itinerary so that we could stay n extra acclimatisation day here if we didn't feel up to the long trek to Gorek Shep then Everest B.C. and back to Gorek Shep the next day, however, it was advised to keep going if possible as it would reduce
                    the risk of altitude sickness. We felt great, so we decided to go for it the next day, i was so excited, <i>"Tomorrow I'm going to BASE CAMP EVEREST!!"</i> I kept thinking! 
                </dd>
                <dt><i>Day 8:</i></dt>
                <DD>It was the big day, we are going to B.C. Everest today! We left Loboche(4900m) at about 8:30 AM and we reached Gorek Shep by lunch time. The trek was amazing and I was amazed by the Khumbu Glacier,
                    I had never seen a glacier before and it was completely different to anything I had imagined. In Gorek Shep we refueled with lunch, and both ome water bottled for the trek, and we were off! We were on the final leg to B.C. Everest!
                    I felt great, I have never felt better.
